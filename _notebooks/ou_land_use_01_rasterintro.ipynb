    "> The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides nationwide data on land cover and land cover change at a 30m resolution with a 16-class legend based on a modified Anderson Level II classification system. The database is designed to provide cyclical updates of United States land cover and associated changes. Systematically aligned over time, the database provides the ability to understand both current and historical land cover and land cover change, and enables monitoring and trend assessments. The latest evolution of NLCD products are designed for widespread application in biology, climate, education, land management, hydrology, environmental planning, risk and disease analysis, telecommunications and visualization.\n",

    "- the NLCD covers the entire nation,\n",
    "- it's raster data with pixels being 30m on each side,\n",
    "- the raster values are discrete values based on a modification of a standard land use classification scale,\n",
    "- data is available at different points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a bunch of things that need to be done in order be able to easily use this data to look at the land use on our campus. But, we'll skip those details for now and just work with one GeoTIFF file that I've already created for us. This file is named `ou_land_cover_2021.tif` and you can find it in the `data` subfolder. As you can tell from the filename, this data is for 2021, the latest data available in the NLCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is raster data, so we expect that there are going to be arrays involved. TIFF files also contain spatial metadata that will be extremely important later. So, how do we read and explore this file? You might have guessed that numpy would be involved. It is, in some ways, but there are libraries specifically designed to work with multidimensional raster data. The two we will use are **xarray** and **rioxarray**."
