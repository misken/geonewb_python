This weired regex error seems to be at root of the problem in getting reticulate to 
use the specified conda env. https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/1535

```{r}
# py_discover_config()
```

## Learning from geocompy

https://py.geocompx.org/preface

The book is written with qmd files. 
There is a `convert.sh` file that converts the chapters in qmd format to ipynb
and .py format using quarto.

### Style conventions

Package names are bold.
Folder and filenames are like code.

### Building the book

```
conda run -n quarto_geonewb quarto preview
```

#### Packages needed to build the book

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
jupyter
jupyterlab
ipykernel

rioxarray
geopandas
shapely
cartopy
pystac
planetary_computer

osmnx
rasterstats
contextily



## Packages needed by a user of the notebooks

Figure out all main packages needed and creation environment.yml file. Create
the conda virtual env and test as I write module.

## Chapters

### Introduction to Raster Data

### Introduction to Vector Data

### Introduction to CRS

### GIS Landscape

### Introduction to working with satellite imagery

## Case Study: OU land use

## Notes

What if we did an analysis of land use on the OU campus?

Could get both RGB imagery as well as computing NDVI. The Carpentries course,
https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/09-raster-calculations.html, does
NDVI computations and then creates a classification scheme to create a discrete raster from
the continuous NDVI raster. All quite relevant. Sections before this one do typical 
raster and vector operations such as cropping, reprojecting and matching different layers.



Could look at how things have changed over time.

Would require combo of raster and vector data.

- single and multi-band rasters
- missing data in rasters
- cropping rasters

Where to get the vector data? What kind of vector data exists for the OU campus?

How to do the land use analysis?
